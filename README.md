# Set-Reset-Latch
This repository contains the code and documentation for implementing an SR latch using both Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers. An SR latch is a fundamental building block in digital electronics, and this project aims to demonstrate its implementation and behavior in two different microcontroller environments.
